# Machine-Learning-Group-Project
A team of marvelous analysts at CMU MSBA program are tackling Customer Churn problem with Telco Dataset, with the ultimate goal to build an API to pipeline data, help companies develop customer retention plans and stop losses from customer churn. Our team members includes: Amelie Li, Emily Rupp, Brian Breault, Scott Ellsworth and Ryan Lomicka.

Business Problem

Customer churn, or the loss of existing clients, is a major challenge for companies across industries, especially those reliant on repeat business and customer loyalty.  For the Telco company at the center of our project, churn represents a critical obstacle to revenue growth and sustainability.  When customers churn, the company not only loses immediate and recurring revenue but also must expend resources on new customer acquisition, which is more costly than retaining existing clients.  Our project aims to analyze the companyâ€™s subscription and customer data to create a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting which customers churn.  This will allow the company to proactively address potential churn and strengthen customer loyalty through timely interventions. Predicting customer churn is valuable from a business perspective as it directly contributes to both saving, making money and saves time. 

Thought Process

This is a relatively small dataset from Kaggle, you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alfathterry/telco-customer-churn-11-1-3
We follow the normal way of problem-solving and here are the steps we take:
1. Analyze business problem.
2. Identify data source and refer to articles that discuss and address this problem.
3. Perform EDA and feature engineering.
4. Build a baseline model using rule-based filters, with the assumption that the Telco corp did not work with a DS company before.
5. Build a Logistic Regression model to act as the classifier. 
6. Selected Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC to evaluate the performance for both models.
7. Version control follows through the above steps to make sure intermidiate results and model files are saved properly.
